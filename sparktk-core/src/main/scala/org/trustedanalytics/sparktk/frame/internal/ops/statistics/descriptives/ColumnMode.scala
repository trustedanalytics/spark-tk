  /**
   * Calculate modes of a column.
   *
   * A mode is a data element of maximum weight. All data elements of weight less than or equal to 0 are excluded from
   * the calculation, as are all data elements whose weight is NaN or infinite.  If there are no data elements of
   * finite weight greater than 0, no mode is returned.
   *
   * Because data distributions often have multiple modes, it is possible for a set of modes to be returned. By
   * default, only one is returned, but by setting the optional parameter maxModesReturned, a larger number of modes
   * can be returned.
   *
   * @param dataColumn Name of the column supplying the data.
   * @param weightsColumn Name of the column supplying the weights.
   *                      Default is all items have weight of 1.
   * @param maxModesReturned Maximum number of modes returned. Default is 1.
   * @return The data returned is composed of multiple components:
   *
   *        '''mode''' : ''A mode is a data element of maximum net weight.''<br>
   *        A set of modes is returned. The empty set is returned when the sum of the weights is 0. If the number of
   *        modes is less than or equal to the parameter maxModesReturned, then all modes of the data are returned.
   *        If the number of modes is greater than the maxModesReturned parameter, only the first maxModesReturned
   *        many modes (per a canonical ordering) are returned.
   *
   *        '''weightOfMode''' : ''Weight of a mode.''<br>
   *        If there are no data elements of finite weight greater than 0, the weight of the mode is 0. If no weights
   *        column is given, this is the number of appearances of each mode.
   *
   *        '''totalWeight''' : ''Sum of all weights in the weight column.''<br>
   *        This is the row count if no weights are given.  If no weights column is given, this is the number of rows
   *        in the table with non-zero weight.
   *
   *        '''modeCount''' : ''The number of distinct modes in the data.''<br>
   *          In the case that the data is very multimodal, this number may exceed maxModesReturned.
