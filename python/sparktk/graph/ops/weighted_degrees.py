    **Degree Calculation**

    A fundamental quantity in graph analysis is the degree of a vertex:
    The degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to it.

    For a directed edge relation, a vertex has both an out-degree (the number of
    edges leaving the vertex) and an in-degree (the number of edges entering the
    vertex).

    In the presence of edge weights, vertices can have weighted degrees: The
    weighted degree of a vertex is the sum of weights of edges adjacent to it.
    Analogously, the weighted in-degree of a vertex is the sum of the weights of
    the edges entering it, and the weighted out-degree is the sum
    of the weights of the edges leaving the vertex. If a property is missing or
    empty on particular vertex, the default weight is used.

    Parameters
    ----------

    :param edge_weight: (String) Name of the property that contains an edge weight
    :param degree_option: (String) Either in, out or undirected. String describing the direction of edges
    :param default_weight: (Numeric) Default weight value if a vertex has no value for the edge weight property

    :return: (Frame) Frame containing the vertex id's an their weights

    Examples
    --------

        >>> vertex_schema = [('id', int), ('label', float)]
        >>> edge_schema = [('src', int), ('dst', int), ('weight', int)]

        >>> vertex_rows = [ [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5] ]
        >>> edge_rows = [ [1, 2, 2], [1, 3, 1], [2, 3, 1], [1, 4, 1], [4, 5, 1] ]
        >>> vertex_frame = tc.frame.create(vertex_rows, vertex_schema)
        >>> edge_frame = tc.frame.create(edge_rows, edge_schema)

        >>> graph = tc.graph.create(vertex_frame, edge_frame)

        >>> result = graph.weighted_degrees(edge_weight="weight", degree_option="out")
        >>> result.inspect()
